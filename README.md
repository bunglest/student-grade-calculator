# Student Grade Calculator

A Python program that calculates and analyzes student grades for a single course.  
This project was created as part of a programming assignment to demonstrate Python fundamentals, Git/GitHub usage, and documentation.

- Calculates per-student average grades  
- Determines letter grades using a standard grading scale (A–F)

## 🎥 Screencast Overview

As part of this project, I recorded a 3–5 minute video demonstrating:

1. Running the program from the terminal.

2. Walking through the code in VS Code.

3. Explaining how dictionaries, loops, and conditionals work in the project.

4. Showing how averages, letter grades, and statistics are calculated.
